# Order tracker web app

Order tracker web application for a school project.

Featured technologies:

- Spring boot [Backend]
- Spring Security
- JWT authentication
- Angular [Frontend]
- JPA

To try out this app you will need postgres running and you need an empty database.
In the application.properties you can modify this line: 
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ordertracker

Of course you have to fill the database with data yourself, maybe later I will add an sql script to generate an example database with mock data, and an openapi description.
